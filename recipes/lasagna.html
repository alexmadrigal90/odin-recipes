        <h3>"Mama Mia" Recipe</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

            This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
            
            This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ricotta Cheese</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
            </li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now your done! Hope you enjoy!!</p>
